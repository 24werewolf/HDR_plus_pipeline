# HDR_plus_pipeline
Tim Brooks and Suhaas Reddy's final project for Visual Computing Systems. Implementation of Google's HDR+ Camera Pipeline as described here: http://www.hdrplusdata.org/hdrplus.pdf

##FOR A MORE RECENT VERSION SEE https://github.com/timothybrooks/hdr-plus. That's where we put the final version of our project, and it's still being (lightly) maintained today.

As of 2019, I am unable to answer questions or continue working on this due to a conflict with my job. Please direct questions to that project.
